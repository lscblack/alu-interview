# Minimum Operations

This script provides a function `minOperations(n)` to calculate the minimum number of operations required to reach a certain number `n`.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Save the script to a file named `minimum_operations.py`.
3. Run the script using the following command in your terminal:

```
$ ./minimum_operations.py
```

4. Use the `minOperations(n)` function to calculate the minimum number of operations required to reach the number `n`.
   Example usage:

   ```python
   from minimum_operations import minOperations

   n = 10
   result = minOperations(n)
   print(f"Minimum operations required to reach {n}: {result}")
   ```

Replace `n` with the desired number for which you want to calculate the minimum operations.

Enjoy optimizing your operations!
